# Data Engineering Projects

Welcome to my Data Engineering Projects repository! This space hosts some projects related to data engineering, each developed to address specific challenges and enhance data processing capabilities.

## Projects
- [**Project 1: Redshift Catalog**](https://github.com/alice-thomaz/Data-Engineering/tree/master/P1_Redshift_Catalog)
  - This project aims to provide visibility into the system catalog tables generated by Redshift. The use of these tables has played a crucial role in cataloging, monitoring, and governing our data warehouse. As detailed in the article linked to the project, the process of ingesting these tables may pose some challenges, and I hope that the provided code proves helpful.
  - Data Stack: DBT, Redshift.

- [**Project 2: Databricks x BigQuery**](https://github.com/alice-thomaz/Data-Engineering/tree/master/P2_Databricks_x_BigQuery)
  - This project aims to facilitate data transfer between Databricks and BigQuery. This process plays a crucial role in the migration project to Databricks, considering that we still have active processes and pipelines in Google Cloud.
